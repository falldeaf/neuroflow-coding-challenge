# Neuroflow Coding Challenge

For this project, please create a small front-end application which fulfills a few user "stories" written below. Work in order of the stories, spending no longer than 4 hours on the project. These projects are to assess workstyle and quality of work.

Attached to this email, you will find a file, titled audio_files.json, containing metadata and links to audio files to be used for this project.

Create a single public git repo to host your project and then commit & push to that repo once per story. If you need to push more than once that's okay, it just makes it easier to review if it's once per story.

Feel free to develop however you normally would, and make use of whatever frameworks and 3rd party libraries you think make sense for this project.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out, but specific direction is up to you.

When you're finished, please send back the link to the git repo with your completed work.

User Stories:
As a user, I want to be able to browse audio collection, find content relevant to a category Iâ€™m interested in, and play each audio file
For the listing view, do not show the full description (see second story), but can show any combination of the other attributes to give a good experience to the user
As a user, I want to be able to view a full description of a given audio file
Show full description for the audio file
As a user, I want an error from attempting to play an audio file to be handled gracefully and let me know something went wrong
There are intentional errors in some URLs in the JSON
